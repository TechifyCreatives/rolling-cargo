          https://www.high-endrolex.com/36 From full Container Loads (FCL) &
          Less Container Loads (LCL), Rolling Cargoâ€™s Sea freight solutions
          enable you to ship large amounts of cargo at a competitive rate for
          any destination in the world. LCL is shipment that is less than a
          container load. That means your goods are loaded with other goods and
          you only pay for the volume of goods that you ship. FCL consist of
          shipments of full 20 or 40-foot containers. Payment is made on the
          basis of a full container. We provide freight movement of your cargo,
          customs clearance, and tariff classification. This is all operated by
          our dedicated team of expert freight specialists. They handle all the
          formalities, documentation and tracking required for your imports and
          exports to ensure that they arrive at their destination. Our robust
          port networks, guarantee that your load will safely reach any part of
          the world by sea. We continuously seek to improve our systems and
          service quality, ensuring that you get the very best service
          available. Rolling Cargo provides weekly and monthly departures from
          China, Netherlands, U.K and Dubai to Kenya
